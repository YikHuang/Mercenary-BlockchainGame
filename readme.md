## Game Rule

- The game is called Mercenary. Players have to choose the class that you would like  to fight for and help them conquer the territory. Players can search for the battle.  After winning, you could select a place and add one on it. There would be a  scoreboard which records the points of each class on that place.

- During the battle, it would be 1 on 1. Each player has the same number of squares  and cards. There are five different types of cards which also have their own way of  attacking. The path to winning is using cards to take over enemyâ€™s squares. The more  you get, the possibility of winning would be larger.
